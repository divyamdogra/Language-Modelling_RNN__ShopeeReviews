# Language-Modelling_RNN__ShopeeReviews
Language modeling using RNNs refers to the process of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to understand and predict language patterns. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown:

1. Language Modeling:
   
  Purpose: To predict the likelihood of a sequence of words or to generate text that makes sense.
  
  Example: Given the beginning of a sentence like "The cat sat on the", the model predicts the next word, such as "mat".

2. RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks):

  Purpose: A type of neural network designed to handle sequences of data, like sentences.
  
  How It Works: RNNs process words one at a time, while keeping track of what has been said before (context) to make better predictions about what comes next.

3. Putting It Together:

  Using RNNs for Language Modeling: The RNN is trained on large amounts of text to learn how language works. It learns patterns, grammar, and the likelihood of words following each other.
  
  Application: Once trained, it can generate text, predict missing words, or complete sentences based on the patterns it has learned.
